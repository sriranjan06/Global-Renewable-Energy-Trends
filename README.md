# Analysis and Visualization of Global Renewable Energy Trends

## Objective
- To analyze global renewable energy data and identify trends.
- To visualize the growth rate of different renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydroelectric) in various countries.
- To highlight challenges and opportunities in renewable energy adoption globally.

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from international databases on renewable energy production, consumption, and investments.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Process the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the data through initial visualizations and summary statistics.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze specific trends in renewable energy production, consumption, and investments.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare renewable energy trends across different countries or regions.
6. **Challenges and Opportunities**: Identify challenges and opportunities in renewable energy adoption.
7. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate trends, showing progress and disparities in renewable energy adoption globally.

## Results

The results of this study provide a comprehensive overview of global renewable energy trends, highlighting key findings and potential applications.

### Key Findings

1. **Growth in Renewable Energy Consumption:**
   - Renewable energy consumption, especially solar and wind, has risen significantly over the past two decades due to technological advances and cost reductions.
   - The growth in wind energy is attributed to the expansion of wind farms and enhancements in turbine efficiency.

2. **Regional Disparities in Renewable Energy Adoption:**
   - Geospatial analysis showed significant regional disparities in renewable energy adoption, with China, the US, Germany, and Brazil leading.
   - Choropleth maps visually depicted these disparities in per capita and hydroelectric energy consumption.

3. **Correlation Between Renewable Energy Sources:**
   - Correlation analysis showed positive relationships between renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, which were visualized through a heatmap.

4. **Investment Trends in Renewable Energy:**
   - Investment data indicates a global rise in renewable energy investments, surpassing non-renewable sources, with Europe and Asia leading and other regions rapidly catching up.

5. **Demand of Renewable Energy and Impact on GDP:**
   - Country-specific analyses for China, the US, Brazil, Canada, India, and Germany revealed that increased renewable energy consumption boosts GDP growth and reduces fossil fuel reliance, as shown in time series plots.
